# CLAMOUR

#### The name of this project, CLAMOUR, stands for Collaborative Localization Adapted from Modular Onboard UWB Ranger.

The objective of CLAMOUR is to create self-localizing audioguides for the Chambord Castle Museum's exposition (https://www.chambord.org/en/discovering/the-castle-visit/). These audioguides will generate music based on the visitor's position within the castle.

A prototype of this audioguide was realized in 2018. More details on this prototype and the research behind it can be found in the following paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03247

This project is realized in collaboration by the following laboratories: MIST - Polytechnique, NXI Gestatio - UQAM, INIT Robots - ETS.
